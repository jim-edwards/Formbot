* Please ensure enough space for setting T-Rex 2+, and leave 200mm gap around.

* For beginners, please print with single extruders first, unless you are an advanced user or have experience on working with dual extruder.

* Please close the heated bed when slicing, cause T-Rex 2+ has an independent heating pad-KEENOVO.

* Please wear protective glasses before laser engraving. or else, it'll cause damage to eyes.

* The power of laser is quite high, so it's suggested to work within 2 hours. or else, it'll cause damage to engraver.

* Recommend Temperature: PLA 190-200C, Bed 50-60C; ABS 220-230C, Bed 100-110C.

* If the model you want to print is already 400x400mm, pls do not add "Brim" or "Raft" when slicing, coz it'll be over 400mm after add that.

* High-temp. extruder is suitable for printing filament above 300C, pls do not print ABS or PLA with it. otherwise, it'll be clogged.

* If you need to pull out filament, please extrude it 10mm around by hand first, then pull it out. If you pull out filament directly, it will be easy to clog.
