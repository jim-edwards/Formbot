# Formbot 3D Printers T-Rex 2+ Simplify 3D profiles

## T-Rex 2+ Dual Extruder(Left).fff
## T-Rex 2+ Dual Extruder(Right).fff

These 2 profiles are intended to be used in Simplify 3D using the multi-object printing.  You assign the model parts to print with each extruder.
 
1.  Create a process for each extruder.  Select a different extruder (Left/Right) for each process.

This profile is will setup both extruders to be controlled by Simplify3D.  Useful when one extruder prints the object material and one extruder prints the support material.

## T-Rex 2+ Duplicate Mode.fff

This profile is intended to be used in duplicator mode.

## T-Rex 2+ Single Extruder.fff

This profile is exactly the same as the Dual Extruder(Left), but is named so its easy to identify single extruder prints.
